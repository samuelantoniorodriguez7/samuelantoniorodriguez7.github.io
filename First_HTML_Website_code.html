        <p><b>What about some bold text?</b></p>

        <strong> I suppose I can also stop testing them one by one</strong>

        <em>This is usually used to highlight images</em>

        <p><em>this should be emphasized</em></p>


        <blockquote>I wonder what the "blockquote" one looks like </blockquote>


        <q>Apparently  the 'q' element is used for shorter quotes that sit within paragraphs and I didn't even put <br/> quotations marks around these</q>
